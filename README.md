Damagelog
=========

Shows the damage dealt to a player and by who. It has a menu where you can select how many rounds ago you want to see the data for (configured by default to this round, the previous round and the round before that as a possibility, although this can easily be changed in the code by changing one variable).

Possible commands:
!damagelog <player/@all/...>        - Shows who this player was damage by and for how much
!deathlog <player/@dead/...>        - Shows who killed this player
!killlog <player/@all/world/...>    - Shows who this player killed
